# LUNA16Tutorial
## All credit to LUNA16 Challenge, this repo is merely to help people who are using PyCharm and are new to coding.

Code that works for the LUNA16 challenge tutorial, in PyCharm. I made some fixes to the original code so it would work.
According to LUNA16,
"The purpose of this tutorial is to show to users how to:
Open a .mhd image
Visualize a .mhd image
Read a list of candidates from a .csv file
Transform from world coordinates to voxel coordinates
Extract patches of candidates
Visualize patches of these candidates directly on the CT images"

To use the code, replace the file locations with the location to the data and patches on your computer. Everything else should be the same if you are using PyCharm Professional.

Note that in the tutorial, it recommends to use %matplotlib inline but that is not necessary in PyCharm, the images will display in the right pane.
